GENERAL INFORMATION
Shelter Animals Count (SAC) is a collaborative, independent organization formed by a diverse group of stakeholders to create and share the national database of sheltered animal statistics, providing facts, and enabling insights that will improve animal welfare throughout the country. 

THIS DATASET
The data included in this file is based on SAC machine-learning model that combines data self-reported by US-based shelter and rescue organizations with estimates for organizations that have incomplete data. It is aggregated by state and year. For more information on the data, please visit shelteranimalscount.org/estimation-model

#### 2021 Update

Prior to 2021, the database was limited to cats and dogs and used 14 categories for intakes and outcomes. With a database update in 2021, the species list expanded to include six additional animal types, transfers were disaggregated to capture distance traveled, and a new category for seized/impounded was added (previously counted under "other intakes").

This file combines previous transfer fields with current transfer fields to maintain consistency across the 3-year period. Seized/impounded fields are combined with "other intakes" to maintain consistency across the 3-year period.

Similarly, because additional species were added in 2021, data entry for those new animal types is underrepresented. This file only contains dog and cat species data.
